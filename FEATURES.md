# ProSolve MVP Features - Hackathon Edition

## Simplified Feature List

### 1. Feature Prioritization
**What it does:** Analyze a product idea and score it based on impact, feasibility, and user value. Users can compare multiple features side-by-side to decide what to build next.

**How it works:** Enter a feature description, target users, and success metrics. The AI evaluates feasibility, user impact, and business value, then recommends whether to proceed, test first, or skip.

---

### 2. User Story Generation
**What it does:** Automatically break down a feature into user stories and acceptance criteria. Helps PMs translate ideas into actionable development tasks.

**How it works:** Based on the feature description, the AI generates 3-5 user stories with clear acceptance criteria that developers can use immediately.

---

### 3. Risk Assessment
**What it does:** Identify potential risks and blockers before starting development. Provides specific mitigation strategies for each risk.

**How it works:** The AI analyzes the feature for technical risks, user adoption risks, and business risks, then suggests concrete ways to mitigate them (e.g., "Run user interview with 5 power users before building").

---

### 4. Validation Plan
**What it does:** Suggest how to test the feature before full development. Recommends prototypes, user tests, or A/B tests based on the feature type.

**How it works:** The AI recommends a validation approach (e.g., "Build clickable prototype and test with 10 users" or "Run 2-week A/B test with 20% of traffic") with specific success metrics.

---

### 5. Launch Readiness
**What it does:** Check if a feature is ready to launch by identifying missing pieces like documentation, metrics, or user communication.

**How it works:** The AI reviews the feature plan and suggests what's needed for launch (e.g., "Write user documentation" or "Set up analytics tracking") so nothing is forgotten.

---

### 6. Comparison Tool
**What it does:** Compare multiple features side-by-side to help prioritize. Shows feasibility, impact, and effort for each option.

**How it works:** Select 2+ features and see them in a comparison table. The AI highlights which feature has the best risk/reward ratio and recommends the top choice.

## Implementation Notes

- **Simple Inputs:** Only ask for what's necessary (feature name, problem, users, metrics)
- **Fast Analysis:** AI responds in 5-10 seconds with actionable insights
- **No Complex Setup:** Works immediately without configuration
- **Practical Outputs:** All recommendations are concrete and executable
- **PM-Focused Language:** Uses product management terminology, not generic business terms
